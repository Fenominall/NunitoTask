### ( < ) Test assignment

1. Working with [mockups](https://www.figma.com/proto/Ip7bsgTfPlzszIEyIwXzUa/Testtask---App?node-id=85-576&viewport=947%2C1154%2C0.13&t=VHbEGiTHuye1wCqO-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=85%3A576&show-proto-sidebar=1). You will find [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/Ip7bsgTfPlzszIEyIwXzUa/Testtask---App?node-id=0-1&p=f).
a. There is a splash screen and 3 simple screens with a deliberately minimized set of styles and
components to keep the test assignment as short as possible.

2. Working with REST API (GET). You will find [API documentation](https://www.figma.com/design/Ip7bsgTfPlzszIEyIwXzUa/Testtask---App?node-id=0-1&p=f) (OpenAPI) here.

b. To display radio buttons on the registration form, use the GET /positions method from the API
documentation.

3. Working with REST API (POST) – registration form block “Working with a POST Request”
a. Working with REST API (POST) – registration form screen “Working with a POST Request”.
